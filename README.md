## Jets Project
 * Skill Distillery Week 2 Homework

 ### Description
 This program displays information for different types of aircraft.  Given a menu with different options, the user can choose what kind of information to view or can "build" a custom aircraft.

 ### Technologies Used
 While there are really only a few arrays, it really seems like arrays on arrays on arrays because arrays are hard.  
 Also starring:
 - more arrays
 - for loops
 - different classes for different objects
 - inheritance
 - atom for this README document
 - Eclipse
 - Slack, to get a second set of eyes on my problem code bodies

 ### Lessons Learned
 This was really hard but I'm that much closer to feeling one with arrays.  Each time I connect a dot, I feel like I can move mountains, however, I found that super small mistakes were harder to find and that a second set of eyes can be invaluable to one's sanity.  We can't always have a partner to program with and this is when good programming habits come in handy.

 I wasted a lot of time not asking for help.
